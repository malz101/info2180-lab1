        <h2>Malik Edwards</h2>
        <p>I am final year student at the University of the West Indies pursuing a
            Bsc. Electronics and Computer Science. I really enjoy anything about
            football whether playing, watching or discussing; football is life!
            <br>
            I am interested in Web Development because I enjoy all types of
            programming essentially and building applications from them. So Web
            Development is just a next avenue that I can express my creativity.
